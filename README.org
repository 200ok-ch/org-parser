* org-parser

=org-parser= is a parser for the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] markup language for Emacs.

To our knowledge, there is no formal specification of Org. But there
is a [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html]['spec' written in prose]] which lead to the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][reference
implementation of Org in Emacs]].

Working on our web-based Org implementation [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/][organice]], we have seen how
brittle existing libraries can be. It would be nice to have a proper
BNF based parser and a set of tests behind that. =org-parser=
strives to be that!

** Development

=org-parser= uses [[https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse/][instaparse]] which aims to be the simplest way to
build parsers in Clojure. Apart from living up to this claim (and
beyond the scope of just the one programming language), using
instaparse is great for another reason: Instaparse works both on CLJ
and CLJS. Therefore =org-parser= can be used from both ecosystems
which, of course, include JavaScript and Java. Hence, it is possible
to use it in various situations.

*** Prerequisites

There's no additional installation required. Leiningen will pull
dependencies if required.
