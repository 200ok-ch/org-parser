** What does this project do?

=org-parser= is a parser for the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] markup language for Emacs.

It can be used from JavaScript, Java, Clojure and ClojureScript!

** Why is this project useful

To our knowledge, there is no formal specification of Org. But there
is a [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html]['spec' written in prose]] which lead to the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html][reference
implementation of Org in Emacs]].

Working on our web-based Org implementation [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/organice/][organice]], we have seen how
brittle existing libraries can be. It would be nice to have a proper
BNF based parser and a set of tests behind that. =org-parser=
strives to be that. It provides a higher-level data structure that is
easy to consume for an application working with Org mode data.

** Architecture

The code base of =org-parser= is split into four namespaces:

- org-parser.core (top level api, i.e. =read-str=, =write-str=)
- org-parser.parse (aka. deserializer, reader)
- org-parser.parse.transform (transforms the result of the parser into
  a more desirable structure)
- org-parser.render (aka. serializer, writer)

Thus =org-parser= has become a misnomer in the sense, that it now
strives to be =clojure/data.org= (after the pattern of existing Clojure
libraries like =data.json=, =data.xml=, =data.csv=, etc) providing
reader as well as writer capabilities for the serialization format
=org=.

* Project State

This project is work-in-progress. It is not ready for production yet.

The biggest milestones are:

- [-] Finish [[http://xahlee.info/clojure/clojure_instaparse_grammar_syntax.html][EBNF parser]] to support most Org mode syntax
      - [X] Headlines and Org mode =#+*= stuff
      - [X] More features
      - [X] Footnotes
      - [X] Timestamps
      - [X] Links
      - [-] Text links
      - [-] Styled text
      - [-] Text that can contain style, links, footnotes, timestamps, ...

- [X] Setup basic from the parse tree to a higher-level structure.

- [ ] Transformations to higher-level structure: catch up with Org mode
      features supported already by the EBNF parser.

Not ready for production yet, *but it can already be useful* for you:
E.g. if your script needs to parse parts of Org mode features, our EBNF
parser probably already supports that. Do not underestimate
e.g. timestamps. Use our well-tested parser to disassemble it in its
parts, instead of trying to write a poor and ugly regex that is only
capable of a subset of Org mode's timestamps ;)

Don't hesitate to contribute!

* Development

=org-parser= uses [[https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse/][instaparse]] which aims to be the simplest way to
build parsers in Clojure. Apart from living up to this claim (and
beyond the scope of just the one programming language), using
instaparse is great for another reason: Instaparse works both on CLJ
and CLJS. Therefore =org-parser= can be used from both ecosystems
which, of course, include JavaScript and Java. Hence, it is possible
to [[#usage][use it]] in various situations.

** Prerequisites

Please install [[https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started][Clojure]] and [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]].

There's no additional installation required. Leiningen will pull
dependencies if required.

** Testing

Running the tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Clojure
lein test
# CLJS (starts a watcher)
lein doo node
#+END_SRC

If you're not familiar with Lisp or Clojure, here's a short video on
how the tooling for Lisp (and hence Clojure) is great and enables fast
developer feedback and high quality applications. Initially, the video
was created to answer a [[https://github.com/200ok-ch/org-parser/issues/4][specific issue]] on this repository. However, the question is a valid
general question that is asked quite often by people who haven't used
a Lisp before.

* Usage

  :CUSTOM_ID: usage

At the moment, you can run =org-parser= from Clojure, Java or from
NodeJS. Other targets which are hosted on the JVM or on JavaScript are
possible.

** Clojure Library

 #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (ns hello-world.core
     (:require [org-parser.parser :refer [org]]))

   (org "* Headline")
 #+END_SRC

** Clojure

=lein run file.org=, for example:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim :exports both
  lein run test/org_parser/fixtures/schedule_with_repeater.org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {:headlines [{:headline {:level 1, :title "Header with repeater"}, :section {:ast [[:text [:text-normal "  SCHEDULED: "] [:text-normal "<2019-11-27 Wed "] [:text-normal "+1d>"]]], :raw ["  SCHEDULED: <2019-11-27 Wed +1d>"]}}]}
:

** NodeJS

First, compile =org-parser= with:

: lein cljsbuild once main; chmod +x ./target/org-parser.js

=./target/org-parser.js file.org=, for example:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim :exports both
  ./target/org-parser.js test/org_parser/fixtures/schedule_with_repeater.org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [["headline",{"level":1,"title":"Header with repeater"}],["content","[:text [:text-normal \"  SCHEDULED: \"] [:text-normal \"<2019-11-27 Wed \"] [:text-normal \"+1d>\"]]\n"]]

** Java

First, compile =org-parser= with: =lein uberjar=.

=java -jar target/uberjar/org-parser-*-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar file.org=, for example:

#+begin_src sh :results verbatim :exports both
  java -jar target/uberjar/org-parser-*-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar test/org_parser/fixtures/schedule_with_repeater.org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {:headlines [{:headline {:level 1, :title "Header with repeater"}, :section {:ast [[:text [:text-normal "  SCHEDULED: "] [:text-normal "<2019-11-27 Wed "] [:text-normal "+1d>"]]], :raw ["  SCHEDULED: <2019-11-27 Wed +1d>"]}}]}
:

Note: The =*= character must be replaced with the current version number of org-parser.
